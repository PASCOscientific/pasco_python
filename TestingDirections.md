# Master Guide
- `ToDo.md` has a list of setting and sensing functionality involved with steppers, servos, power output board, range finder, and line follower. The items marked as written are ready to be tested.
- `documentation.md` has a technical walk-through of the key concepts involved in communicating with the control node, focusing on communication synchronization and plugin-sensor initialization.
- `codeNode.py` and `controlNode.py` have some basic tests for those devices.
- `sensors.py` is a simple script for connecting to any sensor and taking a benchmark sample rate.
- `maintainRange.py` is a fun test of what the pascobot can do, combining setting and sensing. Just for fun, not a project requirement.
- `pasco_bot.py` is another layer allowing easy use of pasco bot. Just for fun, not a project requirement.
